## <b>OPAMP_Follower Example Description</b>

How to configure the OPAMP peripheral in follower mode interconnected with DAC and COMP.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32U575xx Devices at CPU at 160 MHz.

OPAMP1 is configured as following:

   - Follower mode.
   - OPAMP Non Inverting input is connected internally to DAC_OUT1 that perform a simple
     conversion in 8 bits right alignment of 0x7F value.
   - OPAMP Output (PA3 pin 37 CN12) should be connected to COMP1 inverting input (PB1 pin 24 CN12).

Test Description:

   - Push the user Push button to enter normal mode(LED1 On).
   - Push the user alternatively to switch from normal power mode to low power mode
     (LED2 On)and vice versa.
   - Inject voltage higher than 1.65V to COMP1 non inverting input(PB2 pin 13 in CN9).
   - check COMP1 output (PB10 pin 32 of CN10) .
   - If COMP1 output is high test PASS otherwise test FAIL.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set
    to 1 millisecond to have correct HAL operation.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32U575xx devices without security enabled (TZEN=0).

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-U575ZI-Q (MB1549)
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.
